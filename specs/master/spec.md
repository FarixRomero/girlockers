## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**As a dance student**, I want to register on the platform, watch free trial lessons, and request full access so that I can learn locking dance from Girl Lockers instructors worldwide.

**As an administrator**, I want to receive notifications when students request access, approve their accounts, and manage all course content so that I can control who accesses paid content and maintain course quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new visitor on the platform, **When** they complete the registration form with valid email and password, **Then** their account is created and they immediately gain access to trial lessons without admin approval.

2. **Given** a registered student with trial access, **When** they attempt to view a non-trial lesson, **Then** they see a message indicating they need full access and a way to request it.

3. **Given** a student requests full access, **When** the request is submitted, **Then** the admin receives a notification and the student sees confirmation that their request is pending.

4. **Given** an admin receives an access request notification, **When** they approve the student's account, **Then** the student can immediately access all courses, modules, and lessons.

5. **Given** a student with full access viewing a lesson, **When** they watch the video and post a text comment, **Then** the comment appears in the lesson forum ordered by date.

6. **Given** a student viewing a lesson, **When** they click the like button, **Then** the like count increases by one and they cannot like the same lesson again.

7. **Given** an admin viewing lesson comments, **When** they delete an inappropriate comment, **Then** the comment is removed from the forum.

8. **Given** a course with multiple modules, **When** a student views the course, **Then** they see modules organized in order with their respective lessons.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a student tries to register with an email already in use? ‚Üí System shows error message indicating email is taken.
- What happens when a student loses internet connection while watching a video? ‚Üí Video pauses and resumes when connection is restored (browser native behavior).
- What happens when an admin disables a student's account? ‚Üí Student loses access to non-trial content on next page load.
- What happens when a student submits an empty comment? ‚Üí System prevents submission and shows validation error.
- What happens when a student tries to like a lesson twice? ‚Üí System prevents duplicate like (button disabled or request rejected).
- What happens when no trial lessons are marked in the system? ‚Üí System displays message "No hay lecciones de prueba disponibles en este momento" to new students.
